Hi, I'm Nan, a data scientist working at Zalando SE. I've done my PhD on deep learning and computational neuroscience at [Institut f√ºr Neuroinformatik](http://www.ini.rub.de/home) under the supervision of [Prof. Laurenz Wiskott](http://www.ini.rub.de/users/laurenz-wiskott). 

This is my blog for keeping my notes during the journey of data science and machine learning.
